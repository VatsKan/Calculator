Calculator for Founders and Coders Precourse

Main Bugs:
1. clicking on "5" button gives "05" as user input (I think problem with CSS (or JS)).

2. validOp() function in calculator.js is incomplete (need to write all possible invalid cases). e.g. two ops in a row where one or more is times or divide. and all other 'wrong' cases.....but have to be careful of parenthesis as well. (note that parenthesis check is already in place). 

Improvements:
-> rewrite js dom variables in some way to prevent long term bugs (i.e. more easily able to edit html file (i.e. add more buttons) without creating bugs in js file).
