# calculator
Calculator for Founders and Coders Precourse

Main Bugs:
-> clicking on "5" button gives "05" as user input (I think problem with CSS (or JS)).
-> validOp() function in calculator.js is incomplete (need to write all possible invalid cases). e.g. two ops in a row where one or more is times or divide. and all other 'wrong' cases.....but have to be careful of parenthesis as well. (note that parenthesis check is already in place).
